# light-rss

A simple, light and serverless RSS reader.

[Demo](https://light-rss.netlify.com)

## Project setup
```
git clone https://github.com/AsterYujano/light-rss.git
```

```
npm install
```

Modify the `feeds.json` with the feeds' url you like, then run the project

```
npm run serve
```

### Adjust to you

You can fork the project, host it in your github/gitlab/bitbucket account, then modify the `feeds.json` and deploy it on netlify for free with the `npm run build` and targetting `/dist`. Isn't it great ?

If you do, keep me in touch on twitter @Aster_cyber, I would love to see it!

Note: V2 incoming soon ;)
